# Getting started with the SSTuino

*This section is currently under construction - Qian Zhe*

SSTuino is an easy to use Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller, designed and fabricated by SST Alumni. Users can write programs to connect or control things over the Internet. It is derived from the SPEEEduino 1.1 with some improvements.

This tutorial is a simple guide on how to get started with the SSTuino. Further guides will be posted and linked to this page in the future.

## Setting up...

Here are a list of things you require to start using the SSTuino. **Installation of the Arduino IDE and Silicon Labs driver for the CP2102 provided in the SST kit will be covered in the later sections**
* A computer loaded with the Arduino IDE, available [here](http://https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* For MacOS users (and Windows users who have to manually install the driver), please download the Sillicon Labs driver from [this website](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
* The ESP01 Module (WiFi Chip)
* USB to serial converter. The ones included in the **SST kit** is the CP2102.

## Installation of the Arduino IDE
*  Go to the the downloads page [here](http://https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
*  Download the version of the application you require.
   * For MacOS users download the Mac OS X version (10.7) and newer.
   * For Windows users, there are quite a few options:
      * For all devices, you can download either the installer or the zip file. I personally prefer the zip file (as it can be done as a non-admin install, and it is convinent.) However, it is your personal preference for the installation method.
      * Alternatively, for Windows 8.1 and 10, you can go to the Microsoft Store and download it.
