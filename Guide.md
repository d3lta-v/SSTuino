# Getting started with the SSTuino

*This section is currently under construction - Qian Zhe*

SSTuino is an easy to use Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller, designed and fabricated by SST Alumni. Users can write programs to connect or control things over the Internet. It is derived from the SPEEEduino 1.1 with some improvements.

This tutorial is a simple guide on how to get started with the SSTuino. Further guides will be posted and linked to this page in the future.

## Setting up...

Here are a list of things you require to start using the SSTuino.
* A computer loaded with the Arduino IDE, available [here](http://https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* For MacOS users (and Windows users who have to manually install the driver), please download the Sillicon Labs driver from [this website](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
