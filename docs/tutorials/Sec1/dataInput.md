# Data at my fingertips!

In this tutorial, we are going to read from the analog pin of our Arduino, and then use it to do something fun!

## Reading from potentiometer

The potentiometer is essentially a variable resistor. But instead of having 2 pins, it has 3 pins. The potentiometer that is provided in the kit is a 10K Ohm potentiometer, which means that when the knob is turned fully to one end it is 0 Ohm, while at the other end it is 10K Ohm.

Potentiometers are used frequently and comonnly on electronic devices. A simple example would be the volume knob on speakers, or the light dimmers in your houses!
