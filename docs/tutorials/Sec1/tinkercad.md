# My first circuit!

In this tutorial, we will attempt a few simple circuits with a simple to use online simulator, TinkerCAD. After which, we will apply the circuits that we have created into real circuits with components in our SSTuino Kit.

## Hello TinkerCAD!

Say you have an amazing idea at hand and would like to realise it, to which you are thinking: "Hmm, how can I evolve my idea into a real product?"

Meet TinkerCAD, one of the most popular classroom tools for creating simple designs from scratch. It is a simple to use 3D design tool that requires no downloading of software, as it is an online design program.

In this tutorial, we will go through the setting up process of TinkerCAD and have fun with a mini project!

## Our first circuit!

Back to the topic of burning LEDs, here is one huge benefit of using TinkerCAD. As TinkerCAD can simulate circuits, we can test whether we use the correct components and connected it correctly before actually building it.

Let us bring out a 9V battery then connect it as follows.

[!9V_Test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3lta-v/SSTuino/master/Image%20Assets/Tutorial%20Image%20Assets/tinkercad/9V_Test.png)

After you have connected the circuit, click on **Start Simulation** on the top right hand corner of the website.

Once it lights up, this happens.

[!9V_Test2][https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3lta-v/SSTuino/master/Image%20Assets/Tutorial%20Image%20Assets/tinkercad/9V_Test2.png]

The reason this happens is due to the incorrect resistor being used. Remember **[Ohm's Law?](https://d3lta-v.github.io/SSTuino/tutorials/Sec1/electronicBasics.html#the-resistor)** When the resistance is too low the current would be too high.

Instead, connect a resistor like this:

[!9V_Test3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3lta-v/SSTuino/master/Image%20Assets/Tutorial%20Image%20Assets/tinkercad/9V_Test3.png)

With the resistor attached, the LED lights up without burning up. :) Now you try this with different resistor values. What kind of changes happen?

Now, let us try this out using different types of batteries.TinkerCAD mainly provides 3 types of batteries: 9V, 3V and 1.5V. Connect your circuit up as shown.

[!9V_Test5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3lta-v/SSTuino/master/Image%20Assets/Tutorial%20Image%20Assets/tinkercad/9V_Test5.png)

After you connect up the circuit, this happens:

[!9V_Test4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3lta-v/SSTuino/master/Image%20Assets/Tutorial%20Image%20Assets/tinkercad/9V_Test4.png)

Why would this happen?
