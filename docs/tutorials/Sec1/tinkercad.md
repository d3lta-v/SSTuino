# My first circuit!

In this tutorial, we will attempt a few simple circuits with a simple to use online simulator, TinkerCAD. After which, we will apply the circuits that we have created into real circuits with components in our SSTuino Kit.

## Hello TinkerCAD!

Say you have an amazing idea at hand and would like to realise it, to which you are thinking: "Hmm, how can I evolve my idea into a real product?"

Meet TinkerCAD, one of the most popular classroom tools for creating simple designs from scratch. It is a simple to use 3D design tool that requires no downloading of software, as it is an online design program.

In this tutorial, we will go through the setting up process of TinkerCAD and have fun with a mini project!

## Our first circuit!

Back to the topic of burning LEDs, here is one huge benefit of using TinkerCAD. As TinkerCAD can simulate circuits, we can test whether we use the correct components and connected it correctly before actually building it.

Let us bring out a 9V battery then connect it as follows.

Once it lights up, this happens.

The reason this happens is due to the incorrect resistor being used. Remember Ohm's Law? When the resistance is too low the current would be too high.
