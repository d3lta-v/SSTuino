So, you were probably thinking of creating a mobile application but did not know where to start. Welcome to Thunkable! Thunkable is a simple to use platform for developing applications for both Andriod and iOS as it uses block coding, which means that to build an app, all you would have to do is to drag and drop your functions in the build screen.

## Registering for Thunkable

Signing up for Thunkable is very simple. Click the Sign up button on the top right hand corner and sign up either with your Google account or email

After you are done, go to your App Store or Play store to download the Thunkable app as this app is used to visualise the app that you have built in Thunkable.

After you have downloaded the mobile app, simply sign in to the same account as the one you registered to Thunkable with.

## Hello World!

In your project page, you will see that there is a mobile screen and some items to the left hand side of the page. The awesome thing about Thunkable is that you can drag and drop functions that you want in your mobile app!

Let us start off with something simple. We are going to add a text to our app! In the **Add Components** menu, drag and drop the item called **label** onto the screen. Rename the label to `text` and set the font size to `24`.

After you have configured the label, on the top left hand corner of the page, navigate to the tab called **blocks**.

This is the place where you would do your programming!

Programming in Thunkable is very simple as it is also drag and drop. Simply navigate to the function that you would like to insert and place it inside the code section. On the sidebar, click on `Screen1` and drag out this component:



What this does is to tell the app that when this screen opens in the app, do something *(that you will define)*. Next, click on `Label1` and drag out this component:

This is to tell the label we had just created to display a certain text. In the text box, type in `Hello World`.

Next, click on **Live Test** located on the top of the page. Open your thunkable app and you should be able to see your app appearing in the screen!
