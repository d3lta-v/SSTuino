So, you were probably thinking of creating a mobile application but did not know where to start. Welcome to Thunkable! Thunkable is a simple to use platform for developing applications for both Andriod and iOS as it uses block coding, which means that to build an app, all you would have to do is to drag and drop your functions in the build screen.

## Registering for Thunkable

Signing up for Thunkable is very simple. Click the Sign up button on the top right hand corner and sign up either with your Google account or email

After you are done, go to your App Store or Play store to download the Thunkable app as this app is used to visualise the app that you have built in Thunkable.

After you have downloaded the mobile app, simply sign in to the same account as the one you registered to Thunkable with.
