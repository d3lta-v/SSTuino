If your intended product/solution includes a mobile application, there are a variety of app development environments for you to choose from. Thunkable is a simple to use platform for developing applications for both Andriod and iOS as it uses block coding, which means that to build an app, all you would have to do is to drag and drop your functions in the build screen.
