# Actions at my fingertips!

This tutorial will cover the use of the WiFi functionality on the SSTuino board. We will be using it to interface it with a online IoT plaform - Adafruit IoT. Along with Thunkable, the IoT platofrm and the SSTuino, we can essentially create your own automated sensor suite or smart home project. The SSTuino is the main interface of the sensor/controllers, and collects all the sensor data and/or controlls all connected components like LEDs, fan etc.

This tutorial will require the use of the WiFi chip. We have been to clases to flash a new fimware update to the chip.
