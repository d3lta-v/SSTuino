# Actions at my fingertips!

This tutorial will cover the use of the WiFi functionality on the SSTuino board. We will be using it to interface it with a online IoT plaform - Adafruit IoT. Along with Thunkable, the IoT platofrm and the SSTuino, we can essentially create your own automated sensor suite or smart home project. The SSTuino is the main interface of the sensor/controllers, and collects all the sensor data and/or controlls all connected components like LEDs, fan etc.

This tutorial will require the use of the WiFi chip. 

## What is the Internet of Things (IoT) all about?

You may have seen weird things like smart fridges and smart toasters appear in a electronics store, but what is it really about? The term *Internet of Things* covers everything that is connected to the internet, but it is also increasingly used to define objects that communicate with each other. By connecting these devices together to an automated system, the system gathers information, analyses the information and creates an action to help with a certain task - for example a smart thermostat to help optimise the air conditioner operation in your room, saving on the amount of electricity used.

The Internet of Things industry is starting to get very popular in a lot of industries, and is also very popular with DIY makers who use microcontrollers such as the Arduino or the Raspberry Pi to automate lots of everyday stuff.
