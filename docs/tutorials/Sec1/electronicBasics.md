# How to not *burn* your LEDs!

Before we go into electronics, here is what will happen when if you do not handle them well.

## Some essentials...

In your SSTunino kit, we have provided some components for you to use, and is listed inside the [parts list page](https://d3lta-v.github.io/SSTuino/tutorials/partsList.html). It provides some basic information about the components too but here is a more detailed explanation about some of the components inside, along with some theoretical electronics knowledge.

## The resistor
### Ohms Law

For a more detailed read, click [here](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-2/voltage-current-resistance-relate/)

Ohm's Law is the most basic relationship between voltage, current and resistance. A circuit is formed when there is a conductive path for electric charge to move. 

The movement of the electric charge is **current**, expressed in Amperes (A). 

The force that enables the electric charge to move, or the potential energy is **voltage**, expressed in volts (v). 

In the circuit, there is bound to be some "friction" that resists the movement of electric charge, and that is **resistance**, expressed in Ohms (Î©).

## Light Emitting Diode (LED)

Somehow or another, you would realise that you would need something to light up! Say hello to the LED! LEDs are small, efficient lightbulbs (that are rather bright). They are found in a large variety of devices like mobile phones, computer screens, the headlamps of the car and even spotlights!

So, you might be wondering how should you place an LED in a circuit? Here are the 3 most important things to take note:

### Polarity is important

As LEDs are essentially diodes, it will only allow current flow in one direction. This is why if you take a look at your SSTuino Innovator's Kit, you would realised that your LEDs have legs that are of different lenghths. Does the different lengths of legs indicate manufacturing defect? On the contary, the legs are specifically manufactured like this so that the you can identify the polarity of the LED easily.

The longer leg of the LED is the **positive** leg and is called the **anode**. The shorter leg of the LED is the **negative** leg and is the **cathode**. 

*But what if you just nice happen to connect it the wrong way? Would it explode?* 

It would'nt. You can just simply reverse the polarity of the LED (i.e flip the thing around) and it will work again!

### More current = More light!

As the LED is brighter (with the same voltage applied), the current draw would be higher. If you happen to purchase super-bright LEDs, you would realise that they drain your battery easily. With this, you can change the brightness of the LED by adjusting the amount of current that goes through it.

### BOOM!

As with most electronics, there is always a limit to everything. Once an LED draws current beyond a certain limit, you can see the colour change and then... it dies. RIP.

So to prevent tragic things like this from happening, we introduce resistors into the circuit to limit the amount of current the LED can draw. But what resistor would be most suitable?
