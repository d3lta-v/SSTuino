# How to not *burn* your LEDs!

---Insert funny gif here lmao---

Before we go into electronics, here is what will happen when if you do not handle them well.

## Some essentials...

In your SSTunino kit, we have provided some components for you to use, and is listed inside the [parts list page](https://d3lta-v.github.io/SSTuino/tutorials/partsList.html). It provides some basic information about the components too but here is a more detailed explanation about some of the components inside, along with some theoretical electronics knowledge.

## The resistor
### Ohms Law

For a more detailed read, click [here](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-2/voltage-current-resistance-relate/)

Ohm's Law is the most basic relationship between voltage, current and resistance. A circuit is formed when there is a conductive path for electric charge to move. 

The movement of the electric charge is **current**, expressed in Amperes (A). 

The force that enables the electric charge to move, or the potential energy is **voltage**, expressed in volts (v). 

In the circuit, there is bound to be some "friction" that resists the movement of electric charge, and that is resistance, expressed in Ohms (uhhh what is the symbol lmao).
