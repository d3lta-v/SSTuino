# Introduction to Arduino Programming

So, let us move on into the programming stage of the SSTuino Innovator's Kit!

## Virtual Programming

Before we go into programming with the Arduino app, let us take things slow with the coding functionality on TinkerCAD!

The Arduino programming language is very simillar to the [C/C++ Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and are actually C/C++ functions that can be called into your code. When the code is uploaded onto the SSTuino, the compiler inside the Arduino IDE will convert it to something that the microcontroller can read.

Create a new circuit on TinkerCAD, and set it up like this:

Now let us go into the coding portion. TinkerCAD is a very simple yet powerful platform to understand Ardunio programming.
