## SSTuino Board

*Notice any difference?*

For students who are familliar with the Arduino UNO, you would realise that it looks pretty simillar to the SSTuino. This is because that the SSTuino is an adapted design from the Arduino UNO. This device shares a lot of similarities as the UNO such as:

- Coding compatability
- Shield compatability due to its simillar pinouts
- Sharing the same components

The major design difference with this board is that it has a extended board footprint to accept a WiFi chip, resulting the SSTuino to be an Internet-Of-Things (IoT) enabled product. This means that the SSTuino can connect to the internet to send/recieve data!


## Breadboard

So you happened to see a retangular shaped block with holes in it and wondered what it was? This block is called a **breadboard** or **prototyping board**. The breadboard is a very important part of your prototype when you develop new things!

In your ICT lessons, your teacher would go through with you on how to connect up your circuit. Moreover, you would be using TinkerCAD to simulate and view your *virtual* circuit before actually building it, preventing any (touch wood) *magic smoke*.

## USB C to Micro USB Cable

The USB C to Micro USB Cable is a unique cable that helps you connect your USB C Mac to the CP2102 MicroUSB Serial Converter. As this type of cable is less commonly seen in the market, please take good care of this wire as it is not easy to obtain one.

## CP2102 MicroUSB Serial Converter

The CP2102 MicroUSB Serial Converter is a very important device to have as it is the communication tool between the computer and the microcontroller (SSTuino). We designed SSTuino to have a external Serial Converter as not only is it modular, where you could change the chip in the event it is spoilt, you could also use the CP2102 to communicate with other serial devices such as the ATTiny85 or the Raspberry Pi.

This is where you would use your USB C to Micro USB cable to plug into this chip for uploading of code from your computer to the SSTuino.

Our team is currently in development of a updated chip design, called the NEU (New Enhanced UART). Stay tuned for more details.

## ESP01S WiFi Chip

The ESP01S WiFi Chip is what sets the SSTuino different from the Arduino UNO. It allows the SSTuino to be able to connect to the internet, allowing the SSTuino to have smart home, automation and internet connected sensor abilities.

Our team is developing more content to help you get started in developing IoT products, so do watch this space for more details.
